Open MCT Coding Exercise for Jamie Vigliotta

Hello! My name is Jamie Vigliotta, this is my submission for the Open MCT Coding exercise.

This is my first time working directly with websockets and I must say, they look fun and full of potential.

Start the open-mct-exercise server. Then...

To fire up the front end, run: "npm install" in the root of webapp.
Once the modules have loaded, run: "npm start".

The server will be running on localhost:8888.

If the mct server is running, then you'll need to add 'localhost:8888' in the server.js file, just as in the instructions for this exercise. Once the server is running, the front end will be able to grab data from it.

Any questions, let me know!
